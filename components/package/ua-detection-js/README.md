## Quick start
Clone the git repo â€” `git clone https://github.com/ahomiya/ua-detection-js.git`

## Features
Extract detailed type and name of web browser, operating system, and device type/model purely from user-agent string with relatively lightweight footprint (~2KB minified). Written in vanilla JavaScript, which means it doesn't depends on any other library.
